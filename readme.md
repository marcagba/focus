# Focus

Time is a valuable resource (one would say the only one), but I figured that I'm not very good at spending it efficiently.
Focus is an attempt to realize a time tracking application which fits my needs:

* Being able to know on which taskes I spend time
* Spending time according to the pomodoro method
* Gathering and displaying simple analytics on my time expenses.

## Userflow

1. Decide what to do
2. Launch the timer
3. Get shit done
4. Pause
5. Repeat
